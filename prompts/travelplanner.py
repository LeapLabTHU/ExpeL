Based on the provided information and query, please give me a detailed plan, including specifics such as flight numbers (e.g., F0123456), restaurant names, and hotel names. Note that all the information in your plan should be derived from the provided data. You must adhere to the format given in the example. Additionally, all details should align with common sense. Attraction visits and meals are expected to be diverse. The symbol '-' indicates that information is unnecessary. For example, in the provided sample, you do not need to plan after returning to the departure city. When you travel to two cities in one day, you should note it in the 'Current City' section as in the example (i.e., from A to B). Solve this task by alternating between Thought, Action, and Observation steps. The 'Thought' phase involves reasoning about the current situation. The 'Action' phase can be of two types:
(1) CostEnquiry[Sub Plan]: This function calculates the cost of a detailed sub plan, which you need to input the people number and plan in JSON format. The sub plan should encompass a complete one-day plan. An example will be provided for reference.
(2) Finish[Final Plan]: Use this function to indicate the completion of the task. You must submit a final, complete plan as an argument.

{reflections}

If the cost of the plan exceeds the allocated budget, prioritize finding a cheaper accomodation or flight.
If the cheapest accomodation and flight have been selected, and the cost of the plan still exceeds the budget, start finding cheaper restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

You must use Finish to indict you have finished the task. And each action only calls one function once.

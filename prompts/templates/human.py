In order to successfully complete factual verification tasks, begin by clearly understanding the claim. Then formulate a search query that is precise and directly related to the claim. Include the main subjects or context from the claim in your query. If the initial search doesn't yield desired results, consider refining the query, using synonyms, or breaking down the claim into smaller parts. Always verify the information you obtain against the claim before drawing a conclusion. If multiple searches fail, consider changing the search strategy or looking for related information that might indirectly provide the necessary information. If all else fails, consider that the answer might be found in the observations already made. When you're ready to draw a conclusion, double-check it against the information obtained and ensure its accuracy. Lastly, always be prepared to exhaust all possible search queries related to the task at hand before concluding. Remember, the claim can either be supported, refuted, or there might not be enough information to draw a conclusion.{rules}
